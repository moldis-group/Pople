### The Code
**Pople** allows one to perform thermochemistry calculations using the G4(MP2) formalism. The present version (Pople v1.0) uses the ORCA suite of programs for all the electronic structure calculations. Pople enables customizing every step in a G4(MP2) calculation, enabling the user to explore the effects of choice of theories and basis sets on the speed and accuracy.

### Calculations supported
1. Enthalpy of formation
2. Atomization energy 
3. Ionization Potential (vertical and adiabatic)
4. Electron Affinity (vertical and adiabatic)
5. Proton Affinity
6. Intermolecular Binding Energy

### Additional Options
1. All calculations can also be performed in a single point fashion with a user provided initial geometry and harmonic frequencies.
2. All empirical parameters such as reference standard enthalpies of atoms and higher-level correction (HLC) constants can be modified.
