## The Code
**Pople** is a toolkit written in Python to perform thermochemistry calculations using the G4(MP2) formalism. The present version [Pople v1.0](https://github.com/moldis-group/Pople) depends on the [ORCA quantum chemistry program package](https://www.faccts.de/orca/) for all the electronic structure calculations. Pople enables customizing every step in a G4(MP2) calculation, facilitating the user to explore effects of level of theories and basis sets on the speed and accuracy.

## Calculations supported
1. Enthalpy of formation
2. Atomization energy 
3. Ionization Potential (vertical and adiabatic)
4. Electron Affinity (vertical and adiabatic)
5. Proton Affinity
6. Intermolecular Binding Energy

* * *

## Additional Options
1. Calculations can be performed in a _single point_ fashion with a user provided initial geometry and harmonic frequencies.
2. Empirical parameters such as reference standard enthalpies of atoms and higher-level correction (HLC) constants can be modified.
